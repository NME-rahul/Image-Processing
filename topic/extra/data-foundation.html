	  <h2 id="DataQuality"># Data Quality</h2>
	  <p>Data quality refers to the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information. There are many definitions of data quality, but data is generally considered high quality if it is "fit for [its] intended uses in operations, decision making and planning".
          <br><br><br></p>
    <h2 id="orgnaizational-models"># Orgnaizational models</h2>
      <p>
        1. Centralized model - 
        In this model, the one person/team maintains the entire data function and is able to fullfill the data needs. The team/person works like a  gatekkeper of data. A centralized system makes the data inaccessible hence provide more security
        <br>
        This model creates the problems because it discourage the profesionals to develop data fluency those who are outside the core team. The core team is fully at mercy and other teams are depedent on them and to access data they have to wait for resolve request. There also may be a lack of communication and mutual understanding as the core team and requestors may have different ideas.
        
        <br><br>
        
        2. The embedded model - 
        It is also called a decentralized model where professional are embedded in functional team(different domains) like data scientists, analysts, marketing team, sales team, enginners team supporting data infrastructure and finnacial team. The professional directly reports to their heads of team so they have a better understanding the needs of individuals.
        <br>
        Embedded model can be problematic if the head of team/department are not data fluent meaning they may not be able to provife proper guidence and support.
        
        <br><br>
        3. The hybrid model - 
        This model is the combination of centralized and embedded model, in which core team and data professional are also embedded in functional teams. As in the embedded model professional reports to their team head in hybrid model they report the Chief Data scientist of the company This fills gap between data nedd and functional experties and now professionals have both techincal and functional head.

    <h2 id="ETL"># ETL(Extract Load Transform) -</h2>
    <p>
      There are three simple methods before performing analysis on data - 
      <br>
      1. Extract - Extraction method involves collecting the data from companies warehouse according to your problem need and discard extra data. Taking useless data in action makes analysis useless so using a good quality data should be your first priority.
      <br><br>
      2. Load - After collecting good quality data you need to load it in a tool that will helps you in performing needed analytical operation. Data tool can be any it totally depends on analysts choice. Their different data tool are available in market nowdays like Microsoft-excel, PowerBI, Tableu, Google-sheets etc.
      <br><br>
      3. Transform - This step involves data cleaning. Every data needs preprocessing before peforming analysis. Data transformation step involes changing data type, data shape/dimension, handling missing values, typos errors etc.
    </p>
	
	<h2 id="ethics"># Ethics in data science</h2>
	<p>Ethics involves systematizing, defending recommending concepts of right and wrong behaviour. Data science involves concepts and techniques that shapes the civilization in a right way.
	<br><br><br></p>
	
	<h2 id="fiveCs"># Five C's in Data</h2>
	<p>
		# Five C's in Data
		1. clean - Clean Data means data that has no missing values, no inaccurate data, no out of
		range data, no typos error etc. Having 100%clean data can be difficult to achieve There can be
		missing or inaccurate value that identify while you perform analysis. Cleaning data is also
		subject to the law of diminishing returns means every more hour you spent on cleaning data
		looks less profitable then amount of energy and time you wested in.
		<br><br>
		2. Consistent - conisitent means no duplicacy. The data you or your orgnaization have should
		be cosistent. inconsistent data makes it more complex to clean and maintain hence requires
		more money. Consistency is strongly coupled with your data management and data geovenence
		policies.
		<br><br>
		3. Conformed - Conformed datam means data that fits in your problem boundries. For example,
		you have to analyze the decrement in performrne of college students result then you shouldhave
		data of student's result of years(limitation is based on the year from when the decrement
		started) any data other then this can makes your analysis obscure.
		<br><br>
		4. Current - When it comes to data, current can be realtive. Stock-market data, needs to be
		real-time if you are using it trade stocks.
		<br><br>
		5. Comprehensive - Comprehensive data is data that spans all the required dimensions of your
		business case. The data should have sufficient depth. if you want to analyze your customer
		then you have to go back a year analyze the patterns of customers. Once you have collected the
		data review it and make sure you are not missing categories of data: columns, years, regios,
		etc.
		<br><br><br>

	<h2 id="EDA">#Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
	<p>Exploratery Data Analysis(EDA) involves using statistics and visualizations to analyze and identify trends in data sets. The primary intent of EDA is to determine whether a predictive model is a fesiable analytical tool for business chellenge or not. EDA helps data scientists gain an understanding of the data set beyond formal modeling or hypothesis testing.
	   <br><br>why is EDA Important?
		Exploratory Data Analysis is essential for any business. it allows data scientis to analyze the data before coming to any assumption. it ensuress that the results produces are valid and applicable to business outcomes and goals.<br>
		- Helps identify errors in data sets.<br>
		- Gives better understanding of the data set.<br>
		- Helps in detecting outliers or anomullous events.<br>
		- Hels understand data set variables and relationship among them.<br>
		<br><br>
		Objectives of expoloratory Data analysis:-<br>
		The goal of EDA is to allow data scientist to get deep insight into a data set.<br>
		- List of outliers.<br>
		- Estimate for parameters.<br>
		- Uncertainties about those estimates.<br>
		- List of all important factors.<br>
		- Conclusions or assumptions as to whether certain indvidual factors are statistically essentail.<br>
		- Optimal setting.<br>
		- A good predictive model.<br>

	  <h2 id="DataPrivacy">#Data Privacy</h2>
	  <p>Data privacy generally means the ability of a person to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent personal information about them is shared with or communicated to others. This personal information can be one's name, location, contact information, or online or real-world behavior.<br><br><br></p>

	  <h2 id="SQLdataExtraction"># SQL Data Extraction</h2>
	  <p>
	  	SQL is the language use to interact with SQL database. There are different statments/query available to extract data from database it's depended on the analysts.
		<br>1. SQL data extraction from single table<br>
		For example, to select the PID, firstname, and lastname from the Patients table, you can write:
		SELECT pid, firstname, lastname FROM Patients<br>
		SELECT * FROM Patients.<br>
		SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE height > 1.5
		<br><br>
		2. Extraction from multiple tables<br>
		In most database applications, you need to pull out data from more than one table. This is particularly true when you are working with a fully normalized database.<br>
		A join allows you to select all the data in one table based on a matching condition from another table.
		There are various types of joins:<br>
		-Inner join<br>
		-Left outer join<br>
		-Right outer join<br>
		-Full outer join<br>
		For example: SELECT p.aid, p.firstname, p.lastname, r.testdescription, r.date, FROM patient p INNER JOIN result r ON p.pid = r.pid WHERE p.pid = "003080567";
		<br><br>
		3. Combined Extraction - <br>
		Another option is to extract data from multipe tables using union operator.<br>
		The UNION operator combines table from various SELECT commands.<br>
		
		For example: SELECT pid, firstname, lastname, testdate, testdescription FROM labtest UNION SELECT pid, firstname, lastname, date, description FROM radtest;
