    <h2># Orgnaizational models</h2>
      <p>
        1. Centralized model - 
        In this model, the one person/team maintains the entire data function and is able to fullfill the data needs. The team/person works like a  gatekkeper of data. A centralized system makes the data inaccessible hence provide more security
        <br>
        This model creates the problems because it discourage the profesionals to develop data fluency those who are outside the core team. The core team is fully at mercy and other teams are depedent on them and to access data they have to wait for resolve request. There also may be a lack of communication and mutual understanding as the core team and requestors may have different ideas.
        
        <br><br>
        
        2. The embedded model - 
        It is also called a decentralized model where professional are embedded in functional team(different domains) like data scientists, analysts, marketing team, sales team, enginners team supporting data infrastructure and finnacial team. The professional directly reports to their heads of team so they have a better understanding the needs of individuals.
        <br>
        Embedded model can be problematic if the head of team/department are not data fluent meaning they may not be able to provife proper guidence and support.
        
        <br><br>
        3. The hybrid model - 
        This model is the combination of centralized and embedded model, in which core team and data professional are also embedded in functional teams. As in the embedded model professional reports to their team head in hybrid model they report the Chief Data scientist of the company This fills gap between data nedd and functional experties and now professionals have both techincal and functional head.

    <h2># ETL(Extract Load Transform) -</h2>
    <p>
      There are three simple methods before performing analysis on data - 
      1. Extract - Extraction method involves collecting the data from companies warehouse according to your problem need and discard extra data. Taking useless data in action makes analysis useless so using a good quality data should be your first priority.
      <br><br>
      2. Load - After collecting good quality data you need to load it in a tool that will helps you in performing needed analytical operation. Data tool can be any it totally depends on analysts choice. Their different data tool are available in market nowdays like Microsoft-excel, PowerBI, Tableu, Google-sheets etc.
      <br><br>
      3. Transform - This step involves data cleaning. Every data needs preprocessing before peforming analysis. Data transformation step involes changing data type, data shape/dimension, handling missing values, typos errors etc.
